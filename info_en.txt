<div style="padding-bottom:12px;color:999;">
    <p>This plugin validates the VAT-Id of business customers</p>
    <br>
    <p>The validations are:</p>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>1. on the registration of a new customer</li>
        <li>2. on changing the billing address</li>
        <li>3. on each login</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>If a VAT-Id is invalid, it will be removed from customers billing address.</p>
    <p>The same happens, when the validation service is not available.</p>
    <p>If the validation of a VAT-Id of an existing customer fails, you can get informed by an email, validate the Vat-Id manually and as the circumstances require re-enter it to the customer data.</p>
    <p>The validation of the VAT-Id can be set required for business customers.</p>
    <br>
    <p>With this Plugin you can put a simple as well as a qualified confirmation request.</p>
    <p>You also can order an official mail confirmation, if you have a german Vat-Id and customers VAT-Id is foreign.</p>
    <br>
    <p>In each other case, a "really" qualified confirmation request isn't possible.</p>
    <p>If the requested EU member state returns the address data for a VAT Id, it will be compared by the plugin with customers inputted address data.<br>
    <b>Attention: Not every member state returns the address data (p.e. Germany)! In this cases there will also be a simple validation!</b></p>
